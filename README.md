# Image-Caption-Generator-Using-Deep-Learning---VGG19-ResNet50-InceptionV3
Generate caption for images

Introduction

Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision. It includes the labeling of an image with keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. For this project, Flicker8k dataset is used to train the CNN models (VGG19, ResNet50, and Xceptions). The three pretrained models are used for image feature extraction. The extracted features are fed to the LSTM model which in turn generates the image caption. BLEU score is used to evaluate model performance. The performance of the three models are compared.
